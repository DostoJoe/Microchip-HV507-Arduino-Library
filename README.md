# Adafruit MCP23017 Arduino Library

This is a library for the HV507 low-voltage to high-voltage serial-to-parallel converter.

Written by Joe Hill for use in a high voltage electrotactile haptic feedback control circuit.

# Pin Addressing

Pin defaults are as shown below. Each pin assignment can be changed when initialising the HV507 or per variable
